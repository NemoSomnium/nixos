This is my NixOS Framework 13 AMD 7040 setup

Notes:
In order to apply catppuccin-mocha theme for warp-terminal on a new system or after a format of the system these actions are necessary:

``` sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/warp-terminal
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/warp-terminal/themes
```
Manually add the yml file from this repo: https://github.com/catppuccin/warp
Relaunch warp and choose the theme from the settings
